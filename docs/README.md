## LDTS_<T><G> - <Frogger>



**Example**:

In this game, a frog tries to cross a river to save its children on the other side.The problem is the water is getting faster and faster. and there are crocodiles (which might eat the frog). Therefore, the frog has a great challenge. But every time a frog saves the child across the river. Another son appears on the side of another river

This project was developed by *Antonio Augusto Brito de Sousa* (*up202000705*@fe.up.pt)  for LDTS 2022⁄23.

### IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

> This section should contain a list of implemented features and their descriptions. In the end of the section, include two or three screenshots that illustrate the most important features. But this frog can't swim, so use tree trunks as a bridge. 

**Examples**:

- **Move** - the up key moves forward and the down key backwards, as well as left and right.
- **Getting extra lifes** - Sometimes there are medicines on top of tree trunks.
- **speed increment** - When the frog reach the other side of the river, the water speed is incremented, what is more difficult for the frog.
- **Waterfall** - When the frog touch the left side of the screen, he falls into the waterfall and loses a life.
  **Ranking board** - the game has a ranking board with the best scores of another player.

### PLANNED FEATURES

> This section is similar to the previous one but should list the features that are not yet implemented. Instead of screenshots you should include GUI mock-ups for the planned features.
